    "*Lateral movement* is a cyberattack pattern that describes how an adversary leverages a single foothold to compromise other systems within a network.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Lateral movement starts from a foothold where an adversary already has gained access. We'll call this host `A`.\n",

    "The result is to become logged in to another system where the RDP session had been.  We'll call this host `B`.\n",
